## Hi there üëã

You've found KnockbackNemo üê†

I created this portfolio site purely to apply to 2-D Game Design Capstone, so please forgive me if it is not yet polished nor comprehensive. I don't feel particularly confident in any area, but I will present what I have here so that you can at least get an idea of what kinds of things I like doing!

## Art
Room Mural:
I like stars, so I put a sky on my ceiling and added constellations using glow in the dark stickers and paint. I also painted an arctic scene on one of the walls.

This is my Discord profile picture art which I am particularly fond of:

## Music
Here are some compositions I have made. There are ordered (approximately) newest to oldest in hopes that my lack of experience will at least somewhat defend the pain of listening to them.
