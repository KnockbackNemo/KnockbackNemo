## Hi there üëã

You've found Knockback Nemo üê†

I created this portfolio site purely to apply to 2-D Game Design Capstone, so please forgive me if it is not yet polished nor comprehensive. I don't feel particularly confident in any area, but I will present what I have here so that you can at least get an idea of what kinds of things I like doing!

## Art
Room Mural
I like stars, so I put a sky on my ceiling and added constellations using glow in the dark stickers and paint. I also put an arctic scene on one wall.

I also have made one title for one game jam:

## Music
Compositions
Here are some compositions I have made. There are ordered newest to oldest in hopes that my lack of experience will at least somewhat defend the pain of listening to them.
